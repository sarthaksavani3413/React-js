Chosen the Designing Field and today I work as a Team Leader in a very reputable company. And 30+ Employees work in my under right now. And since the job is 8 hours, I do freelance work comfortably. So behind this success, I would like to thank RNW and the mentors there and send a message that every student should recognize their inner strength, advance their career, and take up skill education.",
